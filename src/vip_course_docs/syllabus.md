## Course Prerequisites

Students must be pursuing their undergraduate or graduate degree at NYU in order
to enroll in a VIP course. Enrollment is based on a rolling application process
through the course website. Decisions on acceptance to the course will be made
by the faculty advisors. New student decisions are made by the beginning of each
semester. Students may apply to various VIP course options (i.e., VIP teams),
then select one VIP team to participate on for three consecutive semesters.

***For the Processor Design team in particular:*** Applicants should have
completed CS-UY 2214 or ECE-UY 2204 or have equivalent experience with RTL
design. Team participation assumes familiarity with Verilog and associated
tooling.

## About VIP

The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program operates in a research and
development context. Students join VIP teams by enrolling for credit each
semester for their participation in design/discovery efforts that assist faculty
and graduate students with research and development issues in their areas of
expertise.
The teams are:
  * *Multidisciplinary* -- drawing students from all disciplines on campus
  * *Vertically-integrated* -- maintaining a mix of sophomores through PhD
    students each semester
  * *Long-term* -- each undergraduate student may participate in a project for
    up to three years and each graduate student may participate for the duration
    of their graduate career

The continuity, disciplinary depth, and professional breadth of these teams
intend to:
  * Provide the time and context necessary for students to learn and practice
    many different professional skills, make substantial technical contributions
    to the project, and experience many different roles on a large,
    multidisciplinary design/discovery team
  * Support long-term interaction between the graduate and undergraduate
    students on the team. The graduate students mentor the undergraduates as
    they work on the design/discovery projects embedded in the graduate
    students' research
  * Enable the completion of large-scale design/discovery projects that are of
    significant benefit to faculty members' research programs
