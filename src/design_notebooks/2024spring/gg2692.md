## 2/12-2/19 Week 1

### Work done:

- Created design notebook and worked on Lab 1.
- Began working on Lab 2

### Question Responses:

- 1. The paths are relative to the "src" folder.
- 2. Cmake and Ninja are both build systems, but Cmake offers a higher level of abstraction than Ninja does, as Ninja is used for mostly speed and efficiency when building programs.
- 3. It is important to run cmake it its own directory because the source tree will be kept clean, and any auto generated files will not be polluted with the cmake files.

### Questions to be answered:

- Does the last part of the lab have any output?
- Still a bit confused on the whole Cmake and Ninja toolchain ideas.
