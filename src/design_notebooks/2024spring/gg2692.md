## Week of 2 February 2023

Project Work:

- [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/geoffguin124/NYUProcDesignLabs): Completed Lab 1

I spent this week working on Lab 1, and I didn't really have any issues with the lab, except for
forgetting to save my VScode files. I will be continuing to work on the rest of the onboarding labs,
aiming for getting 1-2 done per week.

## Week of 18 February 2023

Project Work:

- [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/geoffguin124/NYUProcDesignLabs): Completed Lab 2

I spent this week finishing up Lab 2 and trying to familiarize myself with System Verilog. I have worked with VHDL before, so I kind of understand how SV works better than I would if I didn't use VHDL before. I also installed a System Verilog formatter, which makes coding in it a lot easier.

## Week of 25 February 2023

Project Work:

- [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/geoffguin124/NYUProcDesignLabs): Completed Lab 3

This past 10 days I was working Labs 3 and 4. I just finished up Lab 3, linked in the link above. This lab was a bit confusing at first, but eventually I started to understand. I think this is a great way to understand the Cmake toolchain, especially since I didn't understand it too well intially. I want to practice understanding CMakeLists file more, I will do some more reading to understand that.
