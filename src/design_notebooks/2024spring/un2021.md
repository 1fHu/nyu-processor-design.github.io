# Uma Nachiappan's Design Notebook

A confused Doc Czar and her Processor Designing adventures...

## Week of 12 February 2024

Project Work:
* [Documentation Revision]([https://github.com/umanachi/vip_lab1](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/issues/229)): Outlined

After a month without motivation, I started reorganizing the Getting Started docs, since the team came to a realization that it was kind of out of order. Currently mostly outlined but need to commit and rewrite some of the git info. Need to restart core work (both development and some documentation issues from last semester, sorry Michael).
