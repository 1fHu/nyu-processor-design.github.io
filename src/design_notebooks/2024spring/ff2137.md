## Week of 5 February 2024

### Project work:
- [Started lab1 on Annubis (created CMake file and implemented the hello world program)](https://github.com/fatimafarooq03/VIP-Lab1.git)

This week, I spent most of the time figuring out the error I got when I tried to push something from my local machine to my remote github repo but I had no luck so switched to Annubis just to get started with onbaording lab1. I downloaded VS Code with Git Lens extension, and I aim to work on it when working on my local computer. I plan on finishing lab1 by next week as well as successfully setting up the devlopment enviroment on my computer(mac).
