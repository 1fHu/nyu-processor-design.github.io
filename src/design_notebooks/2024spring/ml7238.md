# Michael's Spring 2024 Design Notebook

## Week of January 22, 2024

Project Work:
* [Implemented ID Connection Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/140): Implemented and finished the Verilog module and Verilator tests for the ID connection module.

As this was the first week of the semester I was mostly focused on getting settled back into school but I did manage to finish the ID connection module I started at the end of last semester.

## Week of January 29, 2024

Project Work:
* [Fixed Branch Manager Errors](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/143): Fixed errors in the Branch Manager module and test that were overlooked due to the module's absence from the CMake files as noted by Xingzhi.
* [Changed Titles of Labs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/207): Changed the titles of the onboarding labs from Week # to Lab # as the former naming scheme implied the labs should only be done one week at a time which is quite a slow pace, especially for some of the earlier labs.
* [Updated Summary Page with Spring 2024 Design Notebooks](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/commit/d263eebcaa880c5c4d8b9791cfd59377c2b6c97c): Updated the summary page of the website to include the new folder for the Spring 2024 design notebook entries.
* [Assigned Rielle to work on Core Intro Guide](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/142): Assigned Rielle to work on a detailed introduction guideline for new members joining the Core Team which helps explain how the team works and how the core repo is structured.

The team officially spun into gear this week as new members start to work on the onboarding labs and existing members start to pick up where they left off in the fall. As such, I sent messages to existing core team members with unfinished work from the fall to check that they planned to remain with the team this semester and were good to keep working on their existing tasks. Most of the people I messaged have at this point confirmed they plan to continue their work from the fall but I am still waiting on a couple more responses which I hope to get soon. 

One of the people who did respond, Xingzhi, noticed while continuing his work on the Branch Control connection module that the Branch Manager module was not included in the CMake files and that it caused several syntax errors when it was added. It quickly became clear to me that I had forgotten to add both the Branch Manager module and its test to the CMake files when I first made them so they were never properly tested. I quickly attended the CMake files and fixed the syntax errors in the Verilog code for the Branch Manager. Once I had done that it also became clear that there were errors in the Branch Manager tests where I was checking against the wrong output value for certain cases, so I fixed that issue as well. With those various fixes made the Branch Manager now worked properly and was no longer missing from the CMake files. 

Since new people will be joining the team this semester, I wanted to make a few improvements to the Website repo that I had been meaning to do for a while. Namely, I wanted to finally change the onboarding lab titles from Week # to Lab # so that new members would not be encouraged to only do a single lab per week. Last semester we had a major issue where it took around half the semester for the first of the new members to finish the onboarding labs. Given that there are only 4 complete labs, as Lab 5 does not yet have an associated exercise to complete, and that a significant portion of the first lab is copy-pasting text into files, it should only take 3 to 4 weeks for new members to make their way through the labs as evidenced by how quickly people completed the labs in Spring 2023. While there are certainly more significant issues that led to the slow progress last semester which we are hoping to address this semester, at the very least we shouldn't be actively encouraging new members to clock out for the week after they finish a single on-boarding lab by titling the labs as week numbers.

Finally, I also wanted to start work on a more detailed Core repo and team introduction document to complement our existing development and testing guidelines document. At this point, navigating the Core repo along with the associated links and projects is second nature for me, but it can be confusing for new members, especially those new to GitHub. As such, this introduction document will serve to help new members understand the layout of the Core repo and more quickly and easily find the resources they need. This is especially true for the projects associated with the repo as the Core Design and Implementation project is essential to our workflow but is hard to find and easily confused with the General Core Tasks project. Thankfully, Rielle reached out asking if there was anything she could work on and agreed to take on the tasks for creating this intro guide.

## Week of February 5, 2024

Project Work:
* [Outlined Top Level Connection Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/144): Finished the outline for the Top Level Connection Module.
* [Started Updating Module Tests](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/152): Started updating the module tests to use the new format Vito described. So far I have updated the tests for the EX/MEM Latch test, MEM/WB Latch, and Program Counter.
* [Reviewed Rielle's Starter Doc PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/145): Reviewed the introduction document Rielle made for the Core Repo and asked her to also update the dev and test document with the new test format.

The big thing this week was the new test format Vito asked us to use. Apparently, we were not grabbing device references correctly and this was causing issues. He also presented a better testing method than random numbers in order to get consistent input range coverage. Vito updated the ALU test as an example and I have been working through all the tests to change them to the new format. It should be noted that many of the tests can be cleaned up further through consolidation of similar functions but I want to get all the tests moved over to the new format first and then we can worry about code cleanliness.

## Week of February 12, 2024

Project Work:
* [Continued Work on Updating Module Tests](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/152): Continued updating the module tests with the new format. This week I finished updating tests for the Branch Evaluator, Pipeline Reset Module, Branch Manager, CPU General Purpose Registers, and Branch Address Calculator.
* [Reviewed and Merged Rielle's Starter Doc PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/145): Had Rielle make a few more changes to the new getting started doc and existing dev and test guidelines doc and then merged the changed.
* [Updated Core Links in Lab 7](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/commit/ef2ab82d30da4b8049b900853105eef94a020f28): Added a new link to Lab 7 that takes people to the new Core Team getting started doc.
* [Merged L1 Cache PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/889d6077905a8af8b316b49c64898d4c2cb00006): Confirmed that Surya will not be rejoining the team semester so merged the existing progress made on the L1 Data Cache.

I continued working through the tests this week and am now about two-thirds of the way through updating them, at least by the number of tests there are. Many of the remaining tests that need to be updated are rather complex, however, so in terms of total work I am probably closer to 50-60% through updating everything. A lot of the work involved is less about changing over the format and more so about consolidating the testing code into two or three functions so that I'm not just making a new function for each test case that is nearly identical to the other test functions except for one or two things.

In terms of other things I did this week, Rielle and I went over her pull request for the new introduction document and updates to the existing dev and test guidelines document. She was able to make all the changes I asked for in my review of the PR so I merged her changes meaning we now have a proper introduction guide to the Core Team for new members. I also finally heard back from Surya about whether he would continue his work on the data cache this semester. Unfortunately, he will not be continuing with the team but he did PR all the progress he made last semester, which includes a finished outline and module for the L1 Data Cache. With Surya gone, I do need to find someone to take over work on the data cache. If need be I can take over that responsibility, but given that this is my last semester, I would like to start having other Core Team members take on these more complex tasks so that they can get more familiar with Core as a whole and one or more of them is prepared to take over as Core Czar next semester.
