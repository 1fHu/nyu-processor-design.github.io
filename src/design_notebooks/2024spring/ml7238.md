# Michael's Spring 2024 Design Notebook

## Week of January 22, 2024

Project Work:
* [Implemented ID Connection Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/140): Implemented and finished the Verilog module and Verilator tests for the ID connection module.

As this was the first week of the semester I was mostly focused on getting settled back into school but I did manage to finish the ID connection module I started at the end of last semester.

## Week of January 29, 2024

Project Work:
* [Fixed Branch Manager Errors](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/143): Fixed errors in the Branch Manager module and test that were overlooked due to the module's absence from the CMake files as noted by Xingzhi.
* [Changed Titles of Labs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/207): Changed the titles of the onboarding labs from Week # to Lab # as the former naming scheme implied the labs should only be done one week at a time which is quite a slow pace, especially for some of the earlier labs.
* [Updated Summary Page with Spring 2024 Design Notebooks](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/commit/d263eebcaa880c5c4d8b9791cfd59377c2b6c97c): Updated the summary page of the website to include the new folder for the Spring 2024 design notebook entries.
* [Assigned Rielle to work on Core Intro Guide](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/142): Assigned Rielle to work on a detailed introduction guideline for new members joining the Core Team which helps explain how the team works and how the core repo is structured.

The team officially spun into gear this week as new members start to work on the onboarding labs and existing members start to pick up where they left off in the fall. As such, I sent messages to existing core team members with unfinished work from the fall to check that they planned to remain with the team this semester and were good to keep working on their existing tasks. Most of the people I messaged have at this point confirmed they plan to continue their work from the fall but I am still waiting on a couple more responses which I hope to get soon. 

One of the people who did respond, Xingzhi, noticed while continuing his work on the Branch Control connection module that the Branch Manager module was not included in the CMake files and that it caused several syntax errors when it was added. It quickly became clear to me that I had forgotten to add both the Branch Manager module and its test to the CMake files when I first made them so they were never properly tested. I quickly attended the CMake files and fixed the syntax errors in the Verilog code for the Branch Manager. Once I had done that it also became clear that there were errors in the Branch Manager tests where I was checking against the wrong output value for certain cases, so I fixed that issue as well. With those various fixes made the Branch Manager now worked properly and was no longer missing from the CMake files. 

Since new people will be joining the team this semester, I wanted to make a few improvements to the Website repo that I had been meaning to do for a while. Namely, I wanted to finally change the onboarding lab titles from Week # to Lab # so that new members would not be encouraged to only do a single lab per week. Last semester we had a major issue where it took around half the semester for the first of the new members to finish the onboarding labs. Given that there are only 4 complete labs, as Lab 5 does not yet have an associated exercise to complete, and that a significant portion of the first lab is copy-pasting text into files, it should only take 3 to 4 weeks for new members to make their way through the labs as evidenced by how quickly people completed the labs in Spring 2023. While there are certainly more significant issues that led to the slow progress last semester which we are hoping to address this semester, at the very least we shouldn't be actively encouraging new members to clock out for the week after they finish a single on-boarding lab by titling the labs as week numbers.

Finally, I also wanted to start work on a more detailed Core repo and team introduction document to complement our existing development and testing guidelines document. At this point, navigating the Core repo along with the associated links and projects is second nature for me, but it can be confusing for new members, especially those new to GitHub. As such, this introduction document will serve to help new members understand the layout of the Core repo and more quickly and easily find the resources they need. This is especially true for the projects associated with the repo as the Core Design and Implementation project is essential to our workflow but is hard to find and easily confused with the General Core Tasks project. Thankfully, Rielle reached out asking if there was anything she could work on and agreed to take on the tasks for creating this intro guide.


## Week of February 5, 2024

Project Work:
* [Outlined Top Level Connection Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/144): Finished the outline for the Top Level Connection Module.
* [Started Updating Module Tests](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/152): Started updating the module tests to use the new format Vito described. So far I have updated the tests for the EX/MEM Latch test, MEM/WB Latch, and Program Counter.
* [Reviewed Rielle's Starter Doc PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/145): Reviewed the introduction document Rielle made for the Core Repo and asked her to also update the dev and test document with the new test format.

The big thing this week was the new test format Vito asked us to use. Apparently, we were not grabbing device references correctly and this was causing issues. He also presented a better testing method that random numbers inorder to get consistent input range coverage. Vito updated the ALU test as an example and I have been working through all the tests to change them to the new format. It should be noted that many of the tests can be cleaned up further through consolidation of similar functions but I want to get all the tests moved over to the new format first and then we can worry about code cleanliness.
