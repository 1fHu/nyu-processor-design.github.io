# Working With Your Repo

---

## Purpose

While some developers prefer to use `git` purely from the command line, others
enjoy using the interface built in to their IDE. This is purely a
preference-based decision. In this section, we'll demonstrate how do work
through some common `git` operations using both the command line, and how do to
the equivalent operation using the *GitLens* plugin for VSCode and Anubis.

There is far, far more to `git` than could be productively covered here. It is
highly recommended that you seek guidance from
[the Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for a complete discussion of both
basic and advanced operations.

## Initializing a Repository

Inside a new empty folder, you can create a new `git` repo using the command:

```
git init
```

This is equivalent to using the "Initialize Repository" button in the Git Lens
tab:

<img src="/images/git/init.webp" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />
